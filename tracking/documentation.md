## [2025-01-27] Development Guide Creation

**Status**: Completed  
**Developer**: Assistant  
**Related Issues**: User request for development documentation  

### Summary
Created comprehensive development guide that explains how to use the workspace cursor rules and tracking systems for feature development. This includes task tracking, feature interface consistency, service layer architecture, and documentation standards.

### Tasks
- [x] Explore existing docs structure and navigation
- [x] Create comprehensive development guide explaining cursor rules and tracking
- [x] Update docs navigation to include the new development guide
- [x] Update permanent tracking with this documentation work

### Files Modified
- `docs/development.md` - New comprehensive development guide covering workspace rules, tracking systems, and development workflow
- `docs/_config.yml` - Added "Development Guide" to navigation menu

### Notes
The development guide provides a complete reference for developers on:
- Task tracking system (both session-level todos and permanent tracking)
- Feature interface consistency requirements (CLI + YAML ApplyDocument)
- Service layer architecture patterns
- Documentation standards following Jekyll/GitHub Pages setup
- Changelog and release management with Conventional Commits
- Code quality standards and acceptance checklists

This ensures all developers follow the established workspace rules and maintain consistency across the codebase.

## [2025-01-27] Database User Management Documentation Correction

**Status**: Completed  
**Developer**: Assistant  
**Related Issues**: User feedback about incorrect documentation  

### Summary
Corrected misleading documentation in `docs/database.md` that incorrectly claimed there were two different types of user management (Atlas vs Database). Fixed to reflect actual implementation where all users are created via Atlas API and propagate to MongoDB databases.

### Tasks
- [x] Correct main distinction section between Atlas and Database commands
- [x] Remove false separation between "Atlas users" and "Database users"
- [x] Rewrite Database Users section to clarify Atlas-managed nature
- [x] Update examples to show correct Atlas user creation patterns
- [x] Add clarifying comments in YAML examples

### Files Modified
- `docs/database.md` - Major revision to Database Users section and command distinction explanation

### Notes
The original documentation incorrectly suggested that `matlas database users` commands would create users directly in MongoDB using `createUser` commands. However, the actual implementation shows:

1. All user management goes through Atlas API (`internal/services/atlas/users.go`)
2. The `cmd/database/users/users.go` commands are stubs that redirect to Atlas commands
3. Tests in `database-operations.sh` correctly use `matlas atlas users create`
4. Users created via Atlas automatically propagate to MongoDB databases

This correction eliminates confusion and aligns documentation with the actual codebase behavior. The user management model is: **Atlas API → User Creation → Propagation to MongoDB Databases**.
