# Test Script Updates

## [2025-08-18] Added Atlas Search and VPC Endpoints Tests

**Status**: Completed  
**Developer**: Assistant  
**Related Issues**: Atlas Search and VPC Endpoints feature development  

### Summary
Added comprehensive test coverage for the new Atlas Search and VPC Endpoints features in the matlas-cli project. Created two new test scripts and integrated them into the main test runner.

### Tasks
- [x] Created `scripts/test/search-lifecycle.sh` - Atlas Search lifecycle tests
- [x] Created `scripts/test/vpc-endpoints-lifecycle.sh` - VPC Endpoints lifecycle tests  
- [x] Integrated new tests into `scripts/test.sh` main runner
- [x] Added YAML kind validation support for SearchIndex and VPCEndpoint
- [x] Updated validation system to recognize new resource kinds
- [x] Created example YAML files for documentation

### Files Modified
- `scripts/test/search-lifecycle.sh` - New comprehensive Atlas Search tests
- `scripts/test/vpc-endpoints-lifecycle.sh` - New VPC Endpoints structure tests
- `scripts/test.sh` - Added `search` and `vpc` commands
- `internal/apply/validation.go` - Added validation functions for new kinds
- `internal/types/apply.go` - Added new resource kinds to validation
- `examples/search-basic.yaml` - Example basic search index YAML
- `examples/search-vector.yaml` - Example vector search index YAML  
- `examples/vpc-endpoint-basic.yaml` - Example VPC endpoint YAML

### Test Coverage

#### Atlas Search Tests (`./scripts/test.sh search`)
1. **CLI Tests**:
   - Basic search index listing (✅ Working)
   - Collection-specific index listing (✅ Working)
   - Output format validation (JSON/table) (✅ Working)
   - Create command validation (✅ Working)
   
2. **YAML Configuration Tests**:
   - Basic search index YAML validation (✅ Working)
   - Vector search index YAML validation (✅ Working)
   - Multi-resource YAML validation (✅ Working)
   - Error handling for invalid configurations (✅ Working)
   
3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Help command functionality (✅ Working)
   - Resource preservation (✅ Safe mode implemented)

#### VPC Endpoints Tests (`./scripts/test.sh vpc`)
1. **CLI Structure Tests**:
   - Command help functionality (✅ Working)
   - Proper unsupported error messages (✅ Working)
   
2. **YAML Configuration Tests**:
   - Basic VPC endpoint YAML validation (✅ Working)
   - Multi-provider support validation (✅ Working)
   - Dependencies and standalone configurations (✅ Working)
   - Error handling for invalid providers (✅ Working)

### Implementation Status

#### Fully Functional
- **Atlas Search CLI**: List command working with live Atlas cluster
- **YAML Validation**: Both SearchIndex and VPCEndpoint kinds fully validated
- **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test coverage with safe execution
- **Documentation**: Complete examples and help text

#### In Progress (Expected Behavior)
- **Search Index Creation**: CLI structure ready, execution requires SearchIndexCreateRequest implementation
- **VPC Endpoint Execution**: CLI structure ready, marked as "implementation in progress"
- **Apply/Plan Operations**: YAML validation passes, execution fails gracefully (expected)

### Resource Safety
- ✅ All tests preserve existing resources (--preserve-existing pattern)
- ✅ Atlas Search tests only list existing indexes, no creation during tests
- ✅ VPC Endpoint tests are structure-only, no real endpoints created
- ✅ Proper cleanup of test YAML files
- ✅ Clear warnings about expected failures vs. actual issues

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Run Atlas Search tests
./scripts/test.sh search

# Run VPC Endpoints tests  
./scripts/test.sh vpc

# Run all new feature tests
./scripts/test.sh comprehensive  # Includes search and vpc tests

# Test individual aspects
./scripts/test.sh search cli     # Only CLI tests
./scripts/test.sh search yaml    # Only YAML tests
./scripts/test.sh vpc yaml       # Only VPC YAML tests
```

### Integration with Existing Test Suite
- New tests follow existing patterns from `users-lifecycle.sh` and `applydocument-test.sh`
- Consistent error handling and output formatting
- Same environment variable usage (`.env` file)
- Compatible with existing test infrastructure
- Added to comprehensive test suite

### Notes
- Tests demonstrate that the feature architecture is sound and ready for execution implementation
- All validation and CLI structure work correctly
- Planning failures are expected and handled gracefully
- Full execution will require additional implementation in the apply/executor system
