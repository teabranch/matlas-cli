## [2025-01-07] Release Workflow Improvement

**Status**: Completed  
**Developer**: Assistant  
**Related Issues**: Release workflow best practices  

### Summary
Completely redesigned the release workflow to follow best practices by separating pre-releases from official releases, eliminating duplicate artifact building, and creating a clear branching strategy for different release types.

### Tasks
- [x] Analyze current workflow problems and design better release strategy
- [x] Update semantic-release configuration to create proper pre-releases for main branch
- [x] Refactor CI workflow to properly integrate with release process
- [x] Update release workflow to use CI-built artifacts instead of rebuilding
- [x] Implement proper branching strategy with main for pre-releases and tags for official releases
- [x] Update workflow documentation to explain the new release process

### Files Modified
- `.releaserc.json` - Updated semantic-release config for dual-branch strategy (main=pre-release, release=official)
- `package.json` - Removed unnecessary @semantic-release/exec dependency
- `.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml` - Updated to support main and release branches
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added consolidated artifact creation with checksums
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Redesigned to download CI artifacts instead of rebuilding
- `docs/release-process.md` - Created comprehensive release process documentation
- `docs/_config.yml` - Added release process to navigation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented workflow improvements

### Notes
**Major Improvements:**
1. **Branching Strategy**: Main branch creates `-main.X` pre-releases, release branch creates official releases
2. **Artifact Efficiency**: CI builds artifacts once, release workflow reuses them
3. **Clear Separation**: Development builds vs stable releases are clearly differentiated
4. **Documentation**: Complete guide for developers on how to create releases

**Technical Changes:**
- Semantic-release now supports dual branches with different release types
- CI workflow consolidates all build artifacts with checksums
- Release workflow downloads existing CI artifacts instead of rebuilding
- Added comprehensive documentation with troubleshooting guide

This fixes the confusing release process where every main branch push created incomplete releases.
