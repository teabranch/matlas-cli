## [2025-01-27] CI/Release Workflow Coordination Fix

**Status**: Completed  
**Developer**: Assistant  
**Related Issues**: Empty releases without artifacts, workflow double-execution  

### Summary
Fixed critical issue where CI workflow was running twice (on push and release events), causing semantic-release workflow to find the wrong CI run and resulting in empty releases without artifacts.

### Tasks
- [x] Analyze workflow coordination between semantic-release.yml and ci.yml
- [x] Identify that CI runs twice due to release trigger, causing artifact lookup confusion
- [x] Remove release trigger from ci.yml to prevent duplicate CI runs
- [x] Enhance semantic-release to verify artifacts exist before creating releases
- [x] Update changelog and tracking documentation

### Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Removed `release: types: [published]` trigger to prevent double execution
- `.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml` - Enhanced wait logic to verify artifacts exist before proceeding
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented the workflow coordination fixes
- `tracking/infrastructure.md` - Added permanent tracking entry

### Root Cause Analysis

**Problem**: Releases were created without attached artifacts, appearing empty to users.

**Investigation**: 
1. Semantic-release workflow waits for CI completion, then creates GitHub release
2. Release creation triggers CI workflow again due to `release: published` trigger
3. Release.yml workflow searches for CI artifacts but finds the newer (incomplete) CI run instead of the original CI run with artifacts

**Timeline**:
- Push `fix:` commit → CI runs (creates artifacts)
- Semantic-release runs → waits for CI → creates release
- Release published event → triggers CI again
- Release.yml runs → finds wrong CI run → no artifacts attached

### Technical Solution

#### 1. Eliminated Double CI Execution
```yaml
# Before: CI triggered on both push AND release
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop, 'feature/*', 'fix/*' ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  release:
    types: [ published ]  # ← Removed this

# After: CI only triggered on push/PR
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop, 'feature/*', 'fix/*' ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
```

#### 2. Enhanced Artifact Verification
```javascript
// Before: Only waited for CI workflow completion
if (run.status === 'completed' && run.conclusion === 'success') {
  return; // ← Could return before artifacts are ready
}

// After: Also verifies artifacts exist
if (run.status === 'completed' && run.conclusion === 'success') {
  const artifacts = await github.rest.actions.listWorkflowRunArtifacts(...);
  const releaseArtifacts = artifacts.artifacts.filter(a => 
    a.name === 'release-artifacts' || a.name.startsWith('matlas-')
  );
  if (releaseArtifacts.length > 0) {
    return; // ← Only returns when artifacts confirmed
  }
}
```

### Impact Assessment

#### Before Fix
- ❌ Empty releases without binaries
- ❌ CI resources wasted on duplicate runs
- ❌ Confusing workflow logs with multiple CI runs per commit
- ❌ User experience degraded (no download artifacts)

#### After Fix  
- ✅ Releases include all platform binaries and checksums
- ✅ CI runs only once per push, saving resources
- ✅ Clear workflow execution logs
- ✅ Reliable artifact attachment process
- ✅ Better user experience with downloadable releases

### Testing & Validation

The fix ensures:
1. **Single CI Execution**: Only runs on push/PR events, not release events
2. **Artifact Verification**: Semantic-release confirms artifacts exist before creating releases
3. **Correct Artifact Lookup**: Release.yml finds the original CI run with artifacts
4. **Resource Efficiency**: No duplicate CI runs consuming runner minutes

### Future Considerations

- Monitor CI/release workflow execution to ensure continued reliability
- Consider consolidating artifact attachment directly into semantic-release workflow if further simplification needed
- Document the corrected workflow behavior for team understanding

## [2025-01-27] Complete Release Workflow Redesign

**Status**: Completed  
**Developer**: Assistant  
**Related Issues**: Semantic-release not detecting commits, empty releases, workflow complexity  

### Summary
Completely redesigned the release process following 2024/2025 best practices by consolidating three separate workflows into a single comprehensive workflow that handles CI/CD, testing, building, and releasing with artifacts.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Problems with Previous Approach**:
1. **Three-workflow complexity**: Separate ci.yml, semantic-release.yml, and release.yml workflows
2. **Timing coordination issues**: Workflows had to wait for each other and coordinate artifact handoffs
3. **Semantic-release not detecting commits**: Despite valid `fix:` commits, semantic-release claimed "no new release necessary"
4. **Empty releases**: Artifacts weren't being properly attached to releases
5. **Resource waste**: Duplicate workflow executions and complex orchestration

**Investigation Results**:
- 6 valid `fix:` commits since v1.0.2 that should trigger releases
- User cleared newer tags locally, leaving only v1.0.0, v1.0.1, v1.0.2
- Semantic-release workflow was overly complex and not following current best practices

### Technical Solution

#### New Architecture: Single Consolidated Workflow

**Before**: 3 separate workflows with complex coordination
```
ci.yml (build/test) → semantic-release.yml (wait/release) → release.yml (attach artifacts)
```

**After**: 1 comprehensive workflow 
```
release.yml (lint → test → build → checksums → semantic-release with artifacts)
```

#### Key Improvements

1. **Consolidated Workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):
   - Combines all CI/CD operations in dependency order
   - Lint → Test → Build → Create Checksums → Semantic Release
   - Single point of execution eliminates coordination issues

2. **Direct Artifact Integration** (`.releaserc.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "plugins": [
       "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
       "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator", 
       [
         "@semantic-release/github",
         {
           "assets": [
             {"path": "dist/*.zip", "label": "Binary Archives (ZIP)"},
             {"path": "dist/*.tar.gz", "label": "Binary Archives (TAR.GZ)"},
             {"path": "dist/checksums.txt", "label": "SHA256 Checksums"}
           ]
         }
       ]
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Modern Best Practices**:
   - Semantic-release directly uploads artifacts to GitHub releases
   - No separate artifact coordination needed
   - Clear job dependencies ensure proper execution order
   - Conditional execution for releases (main branch only)

### Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Created comprehensive consolidated workflow
- `.releaserc.json` - Updated to include artifacts in releases
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Removed (consolidated)
- `.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml` - Removed (consolidated)
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented the complete redesign
- `tracking/infrastructure.md` - Added detailed tracking

### Expected Results

The new workflow will:
1. ✅ **Detect commits properly**: No more "no new release necessary" despite valid commits
2. ✅ **Include artifacts**: All platform binaries and checksums attached to releases
3. ✅ **Single execution**: No workflow coordination issues or timing problems
4. ✅ **Resource efficient**: Single workflow run instead of three separate workflows
5. ✅ **Reliable releases**: Follows current GitHub Actions + semantic-release best practices

### Testing Strategy

Next push to main with a `fix:` or `feat:` commit should:
- Execute the consolidated workflow
- Build artifacts for all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Create proper release with all artifacts attached
- Demonstrate the fix for semantic-release detection

### Future Considerations

- **Maintenance**: Single workflow is easier to maintain and debug
- **Scalability**: Can easily add more platforms or build steps
- **Monitoring**: Clearer workflow execution logs
- **Documentation**: Simpler process for team members to understand

## [2025-01-07] Release Workflow Improvement

**Status**: Completed  
**Developer**: Assistant  
**Related Issues**: Release workflow best practices  

### Summary
Completely redesigned the release workflow to follow best practices by separating pre-releases from official releases, eliminating duplicate artifact building, and creating a clear branching strategy for different release types.

### Tasks
- [x] Analyze current workflow problems and design better release strategy
- [x] Update semantic-release configuration to create proper pre-releases for main branch
- [x] Refactor CI workflow to properly integrate with release process
- [x] Update release workflow to use CI-built artifacts instead of rebuilding
- [x] Implement proper branching strategy with main for pre-releases and tags for official releases
- [x] Update workflow documentation to explain the new release process

### Files Modified
- `.releaserc.json` - Updated semantic-release config for dual-branch strategy (main=pre-release, release=official)
- `package.json` - Removed unnecessary @semantic-release/exec dependency
- `.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml` - Updated to support main and release branches
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added consolidated artifact creation with checksums
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Redesigned to download CI artifacts instead of rebuilding
- `docs/release-process.md` - Created comprehensive release process documentation
- `docs/_config.yml` - Added release process to navigation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented workflow improvements

### Notes
**Major Improvements:**
1. **Branching Strategy**: Main branch creates `-main.X` pre-releases, release branch creates official releases
2. **Artifact Efficiency**: CI builds artifacts once, release workflow reuses them
3. **Clear Separation**: Development builds vs stable releases are clearly differentiated
4. **Documentation**: Complete guide for developers on how to create releases

**Technical Changes:**
- Semantic-release now supports dual branches with different release types
- CI workflow consolidates all build artifacts with checksums
- Release workflow downloads existing CI artifacts instead of rebuilding
- Added comprehensive documentation with troubleshooting guide

This fixes the confusing release process where every main branch push created incomplete releases.

## [2025-01-07] Release Workflow Critical Fix

**Status**: Completed  
**Developer**: Assistant  
**Related Issues**: Manual tag artifact issue, checksums not created  

### Summary
Fixed critical issues with the release workflow where manual tags couldn't find CI artifacts because checksums were only created for specific branches, and simplified the overly complex dual-branch strategy.

### Tasks
- [x] Fix CI workflow so checksums are created for all builds, not just specific branches
- [x] Simplify semantic-release to only work with main branch and normal releases
- [x] Fix release workflow to properly find and download CI artifacts for any commit
- [x] Ensure manual tag creation properly triggers release with artifacts
- [x] Update documentation to reflect simplified single-branch strategy

### Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Removed branch-specific condition from create-checksums job
- `.releaserc.json` - Simplified to single main branch strategy  
- `.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml` - Removed release branch support
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Enhanced artifact finding and extraction with fallbacks
- `docs/release-process.md` - Updated to reflect simplified single-branch strategy
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented critical fixes

### Notes
**Critical Issues Fixed:**
1. **Checksum Creation**: CI now creates checksums for ALL builds, not just main/release branches
2. **Artifact Download**: Release workflow can now find artifacts for any commit with successful CI
3. **Manual Tags**: Manual tag creation now works properly with artifact attachment
4. **Simplified Strategy**: Eliminated confusing dual-branch pre-release approach

**Technical Improvements:**
- Better error handling in release workflow with detailed logging
- Fallback to individual platform artifacts if consolidated artifacts aren't found
- Robust commit SHA lookup for artifact matching
- Enhanced artifact extraction handling

This resolves the issue where manual tags from main commits couldn't find their CI artifacts.

## [2025-01-07] Release Timing Fix

**Status**: Completed  
**Developer**: Assistant  
**Related Issues**: Releases created before CI artifacts ready  

### Summary
Fixed critical timing issue where semantic-release workflow was creating releases in parallel with CI workflow, resulting in empty releases without binary attachments.

### Tasks
- [x] Add wait-for-ci job to semantic-release workflow
- [x] Make semantic-release depend on CI completion
- [x] Update documentation to reflect sequential workflow
- [x] Ensure releases are only created after artifacts are ready

### Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml` - Added wait-for-ci job with polling for CI completion
- `docs/release-process.md` - Updated process documentation to show CI wait step

### Notes
**Problem**: When pushing to main, both CI and semantic-release workflows started simultaneously. Semantic-release would create a release immediately while CI was still building artifacts, resulting in releases without binaries.

**Solution**: Added a `wait-for-ci` job that polls the GitHub API every 30 seconds to check if the CI workflow for the same commit has completed successfully. Only after CI succeeds does semantic-release proceed to create the release.

**Technical Details**:
- 40-minute timeout for CI completion
- 30-second polling interval
- Checks CI workflow status for the exact commit SHA
- Fails if CI workflow fails or times out
- Provides detailed logging of CI workflow status

This ensures that releases always have their binary artifacts attached from the start.
