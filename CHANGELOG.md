### Fixed
- **Search CLI Commands**: Removed advanced search CLI commands (analyzers, facets, autocomplete, highlighting, synonyms, fuzzy, metrics, optimize, validate) that returned placeholder data due to Atlas Admin API limitations
- Updated search command unit test to validate 5 basic subcommands (list, get, create, update, delete)

### Removed
- **Advanced Search CLI Commands**: Removed misleading CLI commands for advanced search features
  - These features are properly supported via YAML configuration through the apply pipeline
  - Atlas Admin API embeds advanced features within search index definitions, not as separate resources
  - YAML-based configuration remains fully functional and is the recommended approach

- Eliminated workflow coordination issues that caused empty releases
- Fixed semantic-release workflow creating confusing chore commits that broke artifact attachment
- Removed @semantic-release/git and @semantic-release/changelog plugins to eliminate post-release commits
- Fixed CI workflow running twice (on push and release), causing empty releases without artifacts
- Enhanced semantic-release to verify artifacts exist before creating releases
- Release workflow now consistently finds CI artifacts for the correct commit SHA
- Fixed critical issue where CI artifacts weren't created for manual tags
- Fixed timing issue where releases were created before CI artifacts were ready
- Release workflow now properly finds and downloads CI artifacts for any commit
- Eliminated confusing dual-branch pre-release strategy

- Documentation for database workflows and custom roles under `docs/database.md`
- New command aliases: `db` for `database`; `ls` for `list`; `del|rm|remove` for `delete`
- Enable `DatabaseRole` kind in YAML validation and planning; apply remains unsupported

### Changed
- Enhanced version command with detailed build information
- Updated CI workflow to support release automation
- Improved error messages with actionable hints for authentication, network, timeout, and HTTP failures
- Docker image now includes OCI metadata labels for richer container metadata
