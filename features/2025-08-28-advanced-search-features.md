# Feature: Advanced Atlas Search Features

## Summary

Implementation of advanced Atlas Search features including analyzers, faceted search, autocomplete, highlighting, synonyms, and fuzzy search through YAML configuration. While initially designed with CLI commands, these were removed due to Atlas Admin API limitations that embed advanced features within search index definitions rather than exposing them as separate manageable resources. The YAML-based configuration remains fully functional through the apply pipeline, providing enterprise-grade search functionality while maintaining an honest and accurate API surface.

## CLI Surfaces

### Basic Search Index Commands (Available)
The CLI provides basic CRUD operations that work with the Atlas Admin API:
- `atlas search list` - List Atlas Search indexes in a cluster or collection
- `atlas search get` - Get details of a specific search index by ID or name
- `atlas search create` - Create a new search index with basic or vector search configuration
- `atlas search update` - Update an existing search index configuration
- `atlas search delete` - Delete a search index by ID or name

### Advanced Search Commands (Removed)
The following commands were removed due to Atlas Admin API limitations:
- ‚ùå `atlas search analyzers` - Advanced analyzer management
- ‚ùå `atlas search facets` - Faceted search configuration
- ‚ùå `atlas search autocomplete` - Autocomplete functionality
- ‚ùå `atlas search highlighting` - Search result highlighting
- ‚ùå `atlas search synonyms` - Synonym dictionaries  
- ‚ùå `atlas search fuzzy` - Fuzzy search parameters
- ‚ùå `atlas search metrics` - Search performance analytics
- ‚ùå `atlas search optimize` - Index optimization analysis
- ‚ùå `atlas search validate` - Query and configuration validation

**Reason for Removal**: The Atlas Admin API embeds advanced search features within search index definitions rather than exposing them as separate manageable resources. CLI commands returned placeholder data and were misleading to users.

## YAML ApplyDocument

### Extended SearchIndex Kind
Extended the existing `SearchIndex` kind with comprehensive advanced features:

```yaml
apiVersion: matlas.mongodb.com/v1

## Breaking Changes

**None** - This is a pure feature addition that extends existing functionality without breaking backward compatibility.

## Migration Notes

**Not Required** - Existing search index configurations continue to work without modification. Advanced features are purely additive and optional.

## Future Roadmap

1. **Enhanced Definition Parsing** - Parse existing search index definitions to extract advanced feature configurations for read operations
2. **Metrics Integration** - Connect to Atlas monitoring APIs for real performance data when available
3. **Advanced Validation** - Enhanced validation of complex search configurations before apply
4. **Cross-Feature Optimization** - Advanced recommendations based on feature interactions
5. **CLI Restoration** - If Atlas exposes dedicated APIs for advanced search feature management, restore CLI commands with real functionality

## Conclusion

This feature provides a **realistic and functional approach** to advanced Atlas Search management. Rather than maintaining misleading placeholder commands, it focuses on **what actually works**: comprehensive YAML-based configuration that integrates seamlessly with Atlas Search index definitions. This approach aligns with how the Atlas Admin API actually operates and provides users with genuine functionality while maintaining honest expectations about API capabilities.
