# Docs Markdown Authoring Checklist

This rule applies to all Markdown files under `docs/`.

- Include valid Jekyll frontmatter at the top (`--- ... ---`) with at least:
  - `layout: page` (or `home` where appropriate)
  - `title: <Concise Title>`
  - `description:` (recommended)
  - `permalink:` for top-level navigation pages

- Use relative URLs with Jekyll helpers where possible, e.g. `{{ '/atlas/' | relative_url }}`.
- Keep pages within the site structure and navigation defined in [docs/_config.yml](mdc:docs/_config.yml).
- For code examples, use fenced code blocks with language tags and avoid excessive inline code.
- Images and assets must be placed under `docs/assets/` and referenced with `{{ '/assets/... ' | relative_url }}`.
- Do not add documentation outside the `docs/` directory or bypass the site theme.
