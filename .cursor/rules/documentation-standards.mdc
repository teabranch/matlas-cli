# Documentation Standards

These rules ensure documentation is consistently authored and published.

- All documentation must reside under the `docs/` directory in the repository root.
- Documentation must use the GitHub Pages Jekyll setup and theme configured in [docs/_config.yml](mdc:docs/_config.yml) (theme `minima`, site served from `baseurl: /matlas-cli`).

## Authoring requirements

- New pages must include Jekyll frontmatter (at least `layout`, `title`, and where applicable `permalink`). Example:

```markdown
---
layout: page
title: My Page
permalink: /my-page/
---

# My Page

Content...
```

- Keep navigation consistent with the site menu. Update the `navigation` list in [docs/_config.yml](mdc:docs/_config.yml) when adding or renaming top-level pages.
- Styles should flow through the existing pipeline: add SCSS to [docs/_sass/main.scss](mdc:docs/_sass/main.scss) (or additional partials) and import via [docs/assets/css/style.scss](mdc:docs/assets/css/style.scss). Do not add standalone CSS outside `docs/assets/`.
- Use fenced code blocks with language tags for examples. Syntax highlighting is provided by the site layout and Highlight.js in [docs/_layouts/default.html](mdc:docs/_layouts/default.html).

## Local preview and validation

- Use the documented workflow in [docs/README.md](mdc:docs/README.md):

```bash
cd docs
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

- Ensure the site builds without errors locally and remains compatible with GitHub Pages (respect the theme and plugins defined in [docs/_config.yml](mdc:docs/_config.yml)).

## Do not

- Do not place documentation outside `docs/`.
- Do not change the configured Jekyll theme or `baseurl` without updating site structure, navigation, and deployment expectations.
